Urban Planning and Air quality management using Autonomous Quadcopters

Most major metropolitan areas are facing the growing problems of urban sprawl, loss of natural vegetation and open space. 
Almost everyone has seen these changes to their local environment but without a clear understanding of their impact.
From a long time remote sensing has been used for land management due to the multiple possibilities offered by air borne
space satellites but these are very expensive to build and operate. Moreover, Satellite data is particularly useful for 
detecting major changes in urban land-use because of their low resolution images. Additionally, the movements of people into
urban areas together with the increase in consumption patterns and unplanned urban and industrial development have led to the
problem of air pollution. So, here we propose a system which gives urban planners a clear statistical data about large areas
of land, road mapping and land usage using autonomous quadcopter with onboard image processing techniques. So that ground
crews can save a lot of time by eliminating labor intensive field work. Moreover, it informs us about content of different
gases in our atmosphere in different parts of cities. So, that quick action plans can be taken if air pollution levels near
traffic intersections/busy roadways are exceeding the permissible levels. The versatility of our proposed design simplifies 
overall land management by allowing the integration of geo-registered images with current GIS systems.
